					A Depressing Timelapse

					<p>
						Photo/Video - 5 March 2016
					</p>
					<p>
						This was about a week ago, but when I uploaded it to YouTube the first time, I forgot to mark out on the timeline in LightWorks, so the video ended up being half an hour long (again) and I didn't have a chance to fix it until now.<br>
						This is a timelapse of the last remaining snow melting in my backyard. I'm used to my yard looking like this around mid-March. This was shot in late February.<br>
						We didn't get much snow this year. Normally, we'll have 1 to 2 feet of snow in total by the end of the winter, but since it's been so warm, the snow has been melting out before it can accumulate very much.<br>
						Winter here started late, and ended early, as it has been for the past few years. My school's resident flock of turkeys seems very confused.<br>
						So, here is a timelapse to show how, thanks to global warming, it is now depressing to look outside.<br>

					<p>Tech - 02 March, 2016</p>
					<p>I've recently found a small problem with how I've set this site up, and I figured it might make for an interesting post.</p>
					<p>Before I go into details, I need to explain a bit about how this works. Typically, on a blog, when posting something, the owner logs in through the blog itself, granting them access to a special set of pages, called a back-end, specifically for editing the site. This is just like how, when updating your status on Facebook, you enter your post into a box at the top of the page.</p>
					<p>I don't have a back-end. When I upload a new post, I write it directly into the code for the site.</p>
					<p>This will make most web developers cringe, but it has a few advantages.</p>
					<p>Primarily, this is great for security. It's impossible to hack a back-end that doesn't exist. The only way to change the content of the website is by uploading a new webpage to the server.</p>
					<p>Secondly, it means I don't have to worry about hosting a database for all of my posts, nor do I have to write code to retrieve things from it.</p>
					<p>The reason most people don't do this is that it isn't user-friendly. Since I don't particularly care about that, this method works fine for me.</p>
					<p>However, it has a small issue. When you access a webpage frequently, your browser adds it to your cache. That means that a copy of your page is saved on your computer, to make it easier and faster to access later. When your computer adds my page to your cache, and I post something after that, your cache doesn't include the new post. Normally, this is fine, since the page's content is typically in an external database, so isn't part of the cache. For my site, since I write my posts directly in the page, it's a problem for anyone who accesses the site frequently. (If you aren't stalking me, you're probably fine.)</p>
					<p>So, in a nutshell, if you think something isn't showing up on my site, try refreshing.</p>
					<p>Refreshing - noun - the website equivalent of &quot;have you tried turning it off and back on again?&quot;</p>

						Tech - 29-02-2016
					</p>
					<p>
						Recently, a friend told me that she felt like I would someday create &quot;the BryBox&quot;.<br />
						Apparently, she was referring to me designing a gaming console.<br />
						<a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/user/WubbGmbaa/saved/mRr48d">So here. I did it.</a> (Virtually, that is. I'm not spending the money on a real one.)

						28-02-2016
					</p>
					<p>
						I am finally done rebuilding the site. As you can see, there still isn't anything <i>actually on it</i>, but now that I've got it built the way I want, that's gonna change quickly.<br>
						I spent about half of my day today building this from scratch (aside from finding/making graphics).<br>
						I feel a strong sense of achievement.<br>
						I'm going to bed now.
