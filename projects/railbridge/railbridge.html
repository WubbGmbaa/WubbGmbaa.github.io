				<h3>Rail Bridge Soundscape</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="bodybox-left">
				<p style="margin-top:0px">This soundscape composition consists of three parts, capturing the sonic event of a train crossing the rail bridge across the Mississippi river in downtown St. Cloud, a collaborative performance between the train itself, its supporting infrastructure, and the biophonic and anthrophonic sounds of the surrounding area.</p>
				<p>The first section is recorded from just north of the rail bridge, with a balanced sonic "view" of the train itself, the bridge, and the surrounding river valley. The soundscape begins with a base coat of distant highway noise, biophonic sound from river wildlife, and the ever-growing rumble of a distant train engine, interrupted by a short, soft parp on the train's horn. Over the next minute, the sound of the engine continues to move closer, until the train's horn sounds again as the engine begins to crest over the opposite hill. The engine sound becomes deeper and clearer as the train eases onto the bridge, which creaks under its weight. A series of mechanical noises emanate over the low rumbling drone of the engine, as the sounds of pumps and valves mesh with the creaks of the bridge into a series of percussive snaps. As the engine disembarks the near side of the bridge, it leaves room for the sounds of the train cars behind it as the bridge strains under their weight. The horn gives four more blasts as it moves downtown, which echo across the river and back, marking the end of the first section.</p>
				<p>The second section listens from the pedestrian path beneath the bridge, and each train car's wheels reverberate through the bridge's trusses. This booming sound is accompanied by the footsteps of three pedestrians - two people and one dog, whose collar's jingle is the only sound to ground the setting. The train engine has no role in this section, letting the other sounds to the forefront.</p>
				<p>The third section is recorded from directly adjacent to the tracks, where the sounds of their movement are clearest. A series of bangs transmit from the front of the train down the line, from right to left, to culminating in a metallic thud from the last car. As the final few cars pass off of the bridge and across the street, the sound of a rail crossing bell in the distance emerges, barely audible over the drone of traffic. After a minute, a crow caws, the bell stops, and the recording ends.</p>
